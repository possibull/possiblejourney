# PossibleJourney

A Kaizen-based personal development app that transforms daily habits into measurable progress through intelligent task management and continuous improvement principles.

## üéØ Vision: From 75 Hard to Kaizen

PossibleJourney is evolving from a rigid 75 Hard discipline model to a sophisticated **Kaizen (continuous improvement)** system that adapts to your growth journey. Unlike traditional habit trackers that focus on streaks and all-or-nothing approaches, our Kaizen model recognizes that sustainable progress comes through intelligent task management and measured improvement.

## üå± The Kaizen Task System

### Three Task Types for Sustainable Growth

#### 1. **Growth Tasks** üå±
**Purpose**: Drive measurable progress and skill development
- **Requires**: Progress Rule + Metric Link
- **Examples**: 
  - Workout: "Lift ‚â• last session" (delta_threshold)
  - Taxes: "Complete ‚â• 1 tax section" (count_min)
  - Networking: "‚â• 5 connections in 7 days" (rolling_window)
- **Key Feature**: Check-off only works if the progress rule passes

#### 2. **Maintenance Tasks** ‚öôÔ∏è
**Purpose**: Maintain essential daily habits without pressure
- **Type**: Simple daily check
- **Examples**: Hydration, flossing, daily walk
- **Key Feature**: Missing doesn't restart your program

#### 3. **Recovery Tasks** üõå
**Purpose**: Structured rest and self-care
- **Type**: Restorative activities
- **Examples**: Sleep hygiene, meditation, relaxation
- **Key Feature**: Missing = warning, not restart (encourages rest without penalty)

### Progress Rules Engine

The heart of our Kaizen system is the **Progress Rules Engine** that ensures genuine improvement:

- **`delta_threshold`**: "Lift ‚â• last session" - Must improve from previous performance
- **`count_min`**: "Complete ‚â• 1 tax section" - Minimum quantity requirements
- **`boolean_condition`**: "No phone in bedroom" - Yes/no validation
- **`rolling_window`**: "‚â• 5 connections in 7 days" - Time-based accumulation

**Core Principle**: You can't just check a box - you must actually meet the progress criteria to complete a Growth Task.

### 4. Missed Task Protocol (Instead of Restart)

When a Growth Task fails, we don't restart your program. Instead, we trigger intelligent reflection and adaptation:

**Reflection Questions**:
- "Why did you miss? Too big? Wrong time? Environment?"

**Kaizen Tweaks**:
- **Shrink**: Reduce scope/difficulty
- **Reschedule**: Change timing
- **Swap**: Replace with more suitable task

**Learning Log**: All adaptations are tracked in your program history, creating a personalized learning system that gets smarter over time.

### 5. Review Windows

At Day 7, Day 14, or user-defined intervals, PossibleJourney shows:

**Metric Trends**: Track progress across pillars (Health/Wealth/Relationships)

**Checkbox Loop Detection**: Flag tasks that pass completion but show no metric growth - indicating "going through the motions" without real progress

**Failure Pattern Analysis**: Identify tasks that failed ‚â• 2 times and suggest specific tweaks

**Sprint Maintenance**: Keep your growth plan alive even when individual days go sideways

### 6. Program Modes

Choose your approach when creating a new program:

#### **Strict Mode (Classic)**
- **Philosophy**: Traditional 75 Hard discipline
- **Behavior**: Miss 1 task ‚Üí restart program
- **Target**: Legacy users who prefer the original approach
- **Maintains**: Existing user expectations and habits

#### **Kaizen Mode (Default)**
- **Philosophy**: Continuous improvement with learning
- **Behavior**: Missed Task Protocol + Review Windows
- **Features**: Reflection, adaptation, periodic optimization
- **Target**: Users ready for sustainable growth

**User Choice**: Clear mode selection at program creation, with Kaizen Mode as the default for new users.

## üöÄ Key Features

- **Intelligent Progress Tracking**: Real improvement, not just completion
- **Adaptive Task Management**: Different rules for different types of growth
- **Sustainable Approach**: No harsh restarts, encouraging continuous improvement
- **Comprehensive Analytics**: Track real progress over time
- **Flexible Templates**: Create custom programs for any goal

## üì± Current Status

**Version 2.0** - Major Kaizen Transformation
